# Ringabell #
When I was living in France, there was a church just beside my house. I liked the sound of the bell indicating the time passing by. There isn't anything like this in Canada, so I wanted to try to recreate it with different kind of bell's churches on my computer.


### Description ###
Every hour, a bell rings the same amount of times there are hours
Every half-hour, a bell rings once


### Installation ###
0. Install nodejs
1. Download one of the players listed on the [play-sound](https://github.com/shime/play-sound) page (it is used to play the sound on the computer)
2. Add the player to your path
3. Clone or download this repository and run `npm install`


### Use ###
To use it once, just run `npm start`.
To launch the program automatically with your computer, run `node enable-autolaunch`. If you change your mind, run `node disable-autolaunch`.
